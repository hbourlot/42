#	42 Projects (Lisbon)

This folder contains all the projects Iâ€™ve completed so far at 42 School. Each project showcases different aspects of programming, from low-level C development to more advanced problem-solving skills.

###	Projects Included:


**borntoberoot**: A system security project focused on privilege escalation and binary exploitation.

**ft_printf**: A custom implementation of the C printf function, supporting various formatting options.

**get_next_line**: A function that reads a line from a file descriptor, one of the first steps towards mastering file handling.

**libft**: A custom C library that reimplements standard C functions and utility tools.

**push_swap**: A sorting algorithm project using a limited set of operations to sort data on a stack.

**so_long**: A 2D game development project themed around Pac-Man, utilizing basic graphic rendering and player input.

Each project helped to strengthen my understanding of algorithms, data structures, and system-level programming.
